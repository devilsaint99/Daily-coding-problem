"""Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array
     is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

    For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].
     If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6]."""
